# Training Center — Phase 1 Skeleton

This skeleton provides **packages and empty classes only** for Phase 1.
- You must design and implement all fields, collections, and algorithms yourself.
- No FXML. No FXCollections. Avoid AI-generated data structures/report text.

## Packages
- `com.acme.training.model` — entities + `TrainingCenter` (Singleton shell)
- `com.acme.training.controller` — controllers (signatures to be implemented)
- `com.acme.training.view` — JavaFX to be added later

## Next steps
1. Decide IDs and collections for each entity (lists/maps/queues).
2. Implement `TrainingCenter` stores and search APIs.
3. Implement `RegistrationController` and `SessionController` methods.
4. Add unit/CLI smoke tests.
